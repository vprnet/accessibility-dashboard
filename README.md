# VPR Accessibility Dashboard

This is a work-in-progress prototype for an NPR Member Station Latest News dashboard built specifically with a screen reader in mind.

## Why We're Building This

Obviously what we'd love and ideally what we'd have is a CMS that's accessible to all users. We're doing what we can to stress the importance of the request to our CMS maintainers, but the changes are taking much longer than we'd like.

As such, our intentions behind this project are twofold: 1) we hope this project pushes our CMS maintainers to understand the urgency for our platform to be structured with best web accessibility practices, and 2) until we can get some real CMS changes implemented, we hope this project provides an easy-to-use digital listening experience for our users with vision impairments.
